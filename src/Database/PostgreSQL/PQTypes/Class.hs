  -- | Attempt to receive a notification from the server. This
  -- function waits until a notification arrives or specified
  -- number of microseconds has passed. If a negative number
  -- of microseconds is passed as an argument, it will wait
  -- indefinitely. In addition, there are a couple of things
  -- to be aware of:
  --
  -- * A lock on the underlying database connection is acquired
  -- for the duration of the function.
  --
  -- * Notifications can be received only between transactions
  -- (see <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-notify.html>
  -- for further info), therefore calling this function within
  -- a transaction block will return 'Just' only if notifications
  -- were received before the transaction began.

  -- | Execute supplied monadic action with new connection
  -- using current connection source and transaction settings.
  --
  -- Particularly useful when you want to spawn a new thread, but
  -- do not want the connection in child thread to be shared with
  -- the parent one.
