Efficient and easy-to-use bindings to (slightly modified) libpqtypes,
libpq extension that adds support for binary transport format and
composite types.

Source code of libpqtypes is bundled along with the bindings.

Examples can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/scrive/hpqtypes/tree/master/examples) directory.
